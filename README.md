still taking forever to write the code and get it to look how i want it to look.<br>
i'm noticing how much different it is building your own project versus doing what a course tells you to.<br>
i enjoy this more because it feels like about the game by playing it instead of by reading, watching and thinking about the game.<br>
i should've been doing this since i started my programming course: having my own side project as the reason why i'm taking the course.<br>
so read about coding > watch lectures/videos > do the practice unit in the course > then finally take all the new knowledge to my own project.<br>
that seems to be the best best ideal way.<br>
this is a reiterative discipline, so what you work on doesn't need to be perfect right away.<br>
just keep working on it.<br>
<br>
gonna finish homepage content.<br>
i feel like there's a better way to add content with less code; hopefuly i find it soon.
